#PHP Coding Standards

These are the guidelines that we follow when working on PHP projects at [Devbridge Group](http://www.devbridge.com). We are folowing stadarts defined by Framework Interoperability Group - [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org). The group was bootstrapped by a number of framework developers at php|tek in 2009. Each voting member of the group represents a popular PHP framework (or similar) project. They are working together to create easily reusable code that can be used across other projects. 

##PSR standards

There are five PSR standards described by PHP-FIG.



### PSR-0 / Autoloading standard

The following describes the mandatory requirements that must be adhered to for autoloader interoperability. More information can be found [here](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/).

* * * 

### PSR-1 / Basic Coding Standard

This standard describes what should be considered the standard coding elements that are required to ensure a high level of technical interoperability between shared PHP code. It describes Class Names, Namespaces, Methods, Constants, Properties naming conventions. More information can be found [here](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/).

### PSR-2 / Coding Style Guide

This guide extends and expands on [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), the basic coding standard. Provides a Coding Style Guide for projects looking to standardize their code. It additionaly includes definitions for Control Structures, Closures and other structures. More information can be found [here](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

* * * 

### PSR-3 / Logger Interface

Describes a common interface for logging libraries. More information can be found [here](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/).

* * * 

### PSR-4 / Improved Autoloading

This PSR describes a specification for autoloading classes from file paths. It is fully interoperable, and can be used in addition to any other autoloading specification, including [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/). More information can be found [here](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).

### Additional notes
For objects properties and variables we are using camelCase convention.
